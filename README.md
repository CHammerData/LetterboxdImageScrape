# LetterboxdImageScrape

A quick script i'm building to build shareable images off of a letterboxd.com diary. Essentially wanted to tweet all the movies I watched.

Built using Beautiful soup and requests, nothing particualrly interesting happening here. 

The main file is letterboxdscraper.py. The other two files are essentially scratch paper or alternativ paths that I decided against.
